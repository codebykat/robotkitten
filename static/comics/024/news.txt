poor Robot.  Kitten is kind of a jerk sometimes.

this was inspired, at one or two degrees of remove,

what's the worst mistake <i>you</i> ever made?  it's not an easy question
to answer, because sometimes, in a strange way, mistakes tend to
validate themselves in our lives.
even something you regret may have been what needed to happen at the time,
and something you did accidentally can have
wonderful and unexpected consequences.
maybe Kitten is just trusting in the essential goodness of the universe,
believing it will make the best of even her bad decisions.  cats are
lucky that way -- landing on their feet.

another almost-entirely-sketchbook comic.  i decided to write the dialog 
this time; my handwriting is pretty awful, though.  what do you think?
