this is something i drew in my sketchbook that i really like.  i feel like
i'm getting closer and closer to being able to make something like a "real"
comic, though i'm not exactly sure what that means.<br><br>

i drew all the lines here thinking i was going to redo them on the computer
when i digitized it, but then i decided to leave them.  i think their
un-straightness is somehow kind of charming.  ditto the sketchbook texture.
i don't know, i really like the way this one looks on paper, and i wanted to
keep that feeling as much as possible.<br><br>

in other news, my new commute is pretty great.  it involves walking over a
bridge and alongside a river, and it's super pretty, even in the freezing cold.
there's a camp of ducks and, a little farther down, a camp of geese, and they
have their own peculiar politics and interactions.  (what <i>are</i> birds?  we just
don't know.)  between that and the ever-changing river, i think i could sit
there for hours.<br><br>

anyhow, so much for February.  you gotta carve out your little corner of peace, 
somewhere, in a moment where the weather happens to be sort of okay and 
you're on top of things, just for a second, just breathing, not wanting 
anything.  i try to notice when it happens; i'm not always good at 
remembering to stop chasing the future and just be where i am.
